# Potato Leaf Disease Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify potato leaf images into three categories: **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, and **Healthy**. The model is designed to aid early intervention and reduce crop loss by providing accurate and robust disease detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Plant Village dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), which includes labeled images for various plant diseases, including potato blight. This dataset is available within the repository.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, with images resized to 256x256 pixels. Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like random flipping and rotation are applied to introduce variability, preventing overfitting.
- **Model Architecture**: The CNN model has six convolutional layers with ReLU activations, max-pooling layers, a fully connected layer, and a softmax output for multiclass classification.
- **Training and Optimization**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss over 100 epochs, leveraging data pipeline optimizations for efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes accuracy, loss tracking, and confusion matrix analysis for detailed performance metrics.

## Performance
The model achieves high accuracy across training, validation, and test splits. Performance metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrix visualizations, provide insight into the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen data.
